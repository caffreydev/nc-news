## Overview
This is a React JS project piece, the front end of a social news website that allows users to view, up and down vote, and comment on articles.  

The user has substantial options for interacting with the data, and customising their user experience, which are managed through React state and useParams/useSearchParams combined with dynamic rendering of html, css classes, and components.

There is a hosted backend api server supporting this front end, the public repo for this is linked above, and has substantial detail including how you can reproduce your own api server build.
